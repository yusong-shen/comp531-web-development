Front-End App

In this assignment you will partially implement and test the frontend of your web application. We start with our draft frontend application that contains three views:

- landing page with registration and login
- main page with articles, followers, and status message
- profile page for a user to upload a new profile picture and edit their data

Remember that when tackling any large task our best approach is to divide and conquer. For this assignment there are three major portions:
- Using React+Redux to transform the three views into a single page application (SPA)
- Writing unit tests of the desired functionality and mocking the dummy server endpoints
- Implementing logic for our site and connecting to the dummy server
