1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
The 17th presentation about ARIA by Liuliu. The presentation is well organized and I can feel presenter's enthusiasm. She first mentioned the motivation and introduce some key concepts about ARIA, and the code demo is quite neat.


2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
The 17th presentation about ARIA by Liuliu. I didn't notice this topic before I heard her presentation, it's quite helpful to know ARIA since this can be really useful for those one with disability. I think we can even use it to develop fantastic app with multiple dimension's user experience.


3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
The same as above. It has both rich content and is well delivered. I may try it on my own side project.
