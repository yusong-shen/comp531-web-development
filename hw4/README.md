##Description
There is a Ice Bear trying to catch some fish for dinner. The fish jump from the ice hole, and Ice Bear stand near the hole. When the fish jump out from the hole, Ice Bear use a baseball bat to hit the fish. If the player hit at the right moment, the fish will fly for some distances. The farther the fish flies, the higher score the player get.

##Score Calculation 
How far a fish can fly is determined by the hitting angle. Player will have 10 opportunities, their score is the sum of these 10 hittings.
If player hit fish more than five times, they will get some bonus points.
Some random gold/silver fish can appear with certain possibility, if player hit these fish, blue fish can bring you extra opportunities, gold fish can fly farther with extra bonus. 
Normal fish will jump out from hole at regular speed within a certain range, silver and gold fish will jump at a higher speed hence harder to catch.
